# Checklist for good graphics

This is an exercise to practice the checklist and the characteristics that make a plot readable and easy to understand.

## The checklist

### 1. Data

Focuses on the core data representation and statistical clarity.

- [ ] The type of the graphic (e.g., curve, bars, pie, histogram, cloud) is adapted to the nature of the data.
- [ ] Approximations/interpolation used make sense.
- [ ] Curves are defined by a sufficient number of points.
- [ ] The building method of the curve (interpolation, linear, polynomial, regression, etc.) is clear.
- [ ] Confidence intervals are visualized (or given separately).
- [ ] If the vertical axis shows averages, it should indicate error bars.
- [ ] Steps of histograms are adequate.
- [ ] Histograms visualize probabilities (from 0 to 1).

### 2. Graphical Objects

Guidelines for the visual elements and design choices.

- [ ] Graphical objects are readable on screen, on printed version (B/W), on video, etc.
- [ ] Graphic range is standard, without too similar colors, and without green (for video).
- [ ] It is not possible to remove any object without modifying the readability of the graphic.
- [ ] Curves cross without ambiguity.
- [ ] Grids help the reader.

### 3. Annotations (Labels, Legends, and Axes)

Covers all text, legends, and labeling elements on the graphic.

- [ ] Graphical axis are well identified and labelled.
- [ ] Scales and units are explicit.
- [ ] Axis are labelled by quantities.
- [ ] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained.
- [ ] Units are indicated on the axis.
- [ ] Axes are oriented from the left to the right and from the bottom to the top.
- [ ] Origin is (0, 0); if not, it should be clearly justified.
- [ ] There are no holes on the axes.
- [ ] Each curve has a legend.
- [ ] Each bar has a legend.
- [ ] For bar graphs/histograms, the order of bars is based on classical ordering (alphabetical, temporal, from best to worst) rather than a random order.
- [ ] All the symbols are defined and referenced in the text.

### 4. Information

Criteria for maximizing the density and relevance of the data presented.

- [ ] Curves are on the same scale.
- [ ] The number of curves on a same graph is small (less than 6).
- [ ] Compare curves on a same graphic.
- [ ] A curve cannot be removed without reducing the information.
- [ ] The graphic gives a relevant information to the reader.
- [ ] The graphic produces more information than any other representation (choice of the variable).

### 5. Context (Integration with Text)

Ensures the graphic is well-integrated and explained within a document or presentation.

- [ ] The graphic has a title.
- [ ] The title is sufficiently self contained to partially understand the graphic.
- [ ] The graphic is referenced in the text.
- [ ] The text comments on the figure.

## Figures

These are the analyzed pictures, in each one, only the missing or wrong items on the checklist
will be noted, every non present item can be considered as correct.
