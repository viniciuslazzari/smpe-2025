Network Latency and Throughput Analysis
=====================

The purpose of this project is to analyze the latency and capacity estimation for a network connection with asymmetric measurements. This project will be later peer evaluated by other students in the course in order to enrich the work done and give improvement suggestions.

To explore the measurements interactively using Jupyter, follow these steps:

1. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```zsh
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

```zsh
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

4. In the browser, open the file `analysis.ipynb` located at the repository root and run all cells (`Run -> Run All Cells`).
