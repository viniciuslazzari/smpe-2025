# Why Visualize Data? – Notes

**Topic:** Presentation of Scientific Results  
**Example:** Anscombe’s Quartet

## Key Idea
Four datasets with **identical summary statistics**:
- Mean of X = 9.0  
- Mean of Y = 7.5  
- Slope = 0.5  
- Intercept = 3  
- Correlation = 0.816  
- Residual SD = 1.237  

Yet, their **plots look completely different**.

## Interpretation of Each Dataset
1. **Set 1** – Linear relation with normal scatter.  
2. **Set 2** – Clearly quadratic pattern.  
3. **Set 3** – Contains an outlier influencing the fit.  
4. **Set 4** – Poor experimental design: one distant point dominates the regression.

## Main Takeaways
- Summary statistics alone can be misleading.  
- Visualization reveals structure, outliers, and design flaws.  
- Always plot data before interpreting or fitting models.

**Lesson:** Numbers may look identical, but patterns can differ drastically — visualization is essential for real understanding.
